The journal matrix for the (Microsoft) MAG_20150205 data is in `python/scripts/mag_venue_sparse.mtx`

Python code to load the matrix:
```
import scipy.io
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, coo_matrix
venue_matrix = scipy.io.mmread("venue_matrix_filename")
venue_matrix = venue_matrix.tocsr()
```

The journal IDs are located in `python/scripts/journal_list.csv`. This is a
comma separated list of journal and conference IDs representing labels for the
rows and columns of the journal matrix. Journals are prepended with the letter 'A',
and conferences are prepended with the letter 'B'.

The `MAG_20150205.Journals` database table maps Journal IDs to names (you need to 
strip the 'A' from the Journal ID in the file above).

The `MAG_20150205.ConferenceInstances` database table maps Conference IDs to
names (you need to strip the 'B' from the Conference ID in the file above).

The `Papers` table might also be useful, as it has a column for normalized venue name 
(presumably identified before Microsoft mapped the venue to a Journal or Conference ID).
